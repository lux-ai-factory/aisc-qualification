Two signals, both deterministic:

* **The Annex.** The form's fourteen questions are the points of EU AI Act
  Annex IV, and a technical documentation file is usually written against the
  same Annex. A heading of "Annex IV(1)(a)", or just "1(a)", names the question;

* **Labels.** "System name:", "Provider:", "Intended purpose:" and the handful
  of ways people write those.
