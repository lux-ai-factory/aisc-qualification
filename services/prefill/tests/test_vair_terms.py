"""A document's VAIR terms: the form speaks VAIR, so the upload reads VAIR too.

A term is matched by its VAIR id or its VAIR label, whatever the case and spacing; a word that is
neither is left for the person to choose, never guessed. The lists are the form's own, read from
src/data/vair_vocab.json, so the upload cannot propose a term the form would refuse.
