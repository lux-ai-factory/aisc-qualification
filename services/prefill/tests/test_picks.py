"""The VAIR picks a document names (2026-09-30): the system's type and purpose, and the four tag sets.

The form offers VAIR's own lists for these, so a document can name them the way it names a risk's
terms: a labelled line, each value a VAIR id or label, several separated by commas. A value that names
no VAIR term of its field's class is left out, never guessed. "Purpose:" stays the use case's text,
which is what documents mean by it; the VAIR purpose has its own label.
