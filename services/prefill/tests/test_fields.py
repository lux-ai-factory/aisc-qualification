"""Reading the form's fields out of a document, with no model at all.

The form asks for seven pieces of metadata and fourteen questions, and the
fourteen are the points of EU AI Act Annex IV. A technical documentation file
is usually written against the same Annex, so its own headings are the signal:
"Annex IV(1)(a)", "1(a)", or the labels a person writes, "System name:".

This is what runs on every install. A model can propose more where one is
configured, but nothing here depends on that.
